						Jedis
	Ezra
See above
	Kaanan
See above
	Ahsoka Tano

	Old Ben

	Jedi Knight Anakin

	Grand Master Yoda
The other Jedi grind is for Yoda
	
	
						Scoundrels
	Boba Fett

	Han Solo

	Stormtrooper Han

	Enfys Nest

	Qi'ra


						Others
	Phasma
Casual grind of Phasma merely for future things.

						Ships
Ships is problematic. Boba Fett, Ahsoka Tano, Tie fighter and Phoenix helps build a team.
Exakt grind is uncertain, but should include Slave 1 and Ahsoka Tano Jedi Fighter as well as maxing out Phoenix
I should try and fit in Biggs as well with his ship.
