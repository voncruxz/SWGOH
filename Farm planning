						Others
	Phasma
Casual grind of Phasma merely for future things.

						Ships
Ships is problematic. Boba Fett, Ahsoka Tano, Tie fighter and Phoenix helps build a team.
Exakt grind is uncertain, but should include Slave 1 and Ahsoka Tano Jedi Fighter as well as maxing out Phoenix
I should try and fit in Biggs as well with his ship.
